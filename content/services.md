Are you interested in working with me? Just send me an email at <a href="mailto:&#115;&#101;&#114;&#118;&#105;&#99;&#101;&#115;&#43;&#119;&#101;&#98;&#115;&#105;&#116;&#101;&#64;&#114;&#117;&#110;&#108;&#101;&#118;&#101;&#108;&#48;&#046;&#109;&#101;?subject=Service%20Inquiry">&#115;&#101;&#114;&#118;&#105;&#99;&#101;&#115;&#64;&#114;&#117;&#110;&#108;&#101;&#118;&#101;&#108;&#48;&#046;&#109;&#101;</a>. 
Do you want to discuss something else? Feel free to hit me up anyway!

I can help you with:

* **Developing Applications in the Cloud**: I have architected and developed _greenfield_ and _brownfield_ systems in the context of Containers, Serverless, Web Applications, REST APIs, Distributed Systems, Monoliths, and Event-driven systems. I tend to focus more on the backend side of the spectrum, but I can also work on the frontend when necessary.

* **Migrating and Modernizing Applications on AWS**: I have a proven track record of migrations to AWS, from pre-existing on-premises applications, through database engine conversions, to large-scale migrations using the [AWS Migration Methodology](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud-migration/how-to-migrate/). I have also supported several teams in Modernizing their existing Applications on AWS by employing several Managed Services to enable world-class high-availability, improved Cloud costs, and better productivity in general.

* **Consulting**: I also offer support to companies in developing technical strategies, helping Software teams deliver faster and safer, collaboratively discussing software architecture improvements, and building the bridge between technical and product teams.

_**Sven Ramuschkat**_, Founder of [tecRacer Group](https://www.tecracer.com/) - _October 2020_ (originally in German)

## Technology Stacks and Practices

I am not limited to a specific technology or platform and can become proficient in any technology given enough time. I have worked with the Node.js, TypeScript, Python, and Rust ecosystems in the past and have had a lot of contact with Java and Go systems (plus experimented with a few more).

I have specialized heavily in the [AWS Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/) and know its ins and outs well -- not only from the perspectives of Software Architecture and Development but also Operations, Security, and Governance.

At last, I am an advocate of the _"you build it, you run it"_ mentality and of the [practices](https://minimumcd.org/) necessary for the [Continuous Delivery](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ContinuousDelivery.html) discipline.

## Working Methods

* **With your team**: Colleagues and peers [acknowledge me](#references) as a team member valued for my collaborative and friendly demeanor, complemented by my dedication to continuous technical improvement. I believe in multiplying my impact by supporting and elevating others and enjoy mentoring junior engineers, doing pair-programming, tackling challenging problems with my peers, and engaging with business stakeholders. If there's an opportunity to support your team, I'd be grateful for the chance to contribute.

* **Solo**: I am naturally curious, self-motivated, and have a track record of delivering quality work with minimal guidance, even under pressure. I make a concerted effort to ask the necessary questions and seek out solutions independently. I strive to communicate my findings and results clearly, ensuring that all peers can easily follow my progress.

## Practicalities

* **Location**: I am based in Munich and primarily offer remote services, but I am open to occasional on-site visits outside Munich, especially if you cover my travel and accommodation or agree on an extra flat rate per day of travel. Hybrid or on-site work is also possible if your team is in Munich.

* **Availability**: I am open for part and full-time contracts for 4 or 5 days a week, up to 8 hours a day. I prefer short (3 to 6 months) and mid-term (9 to 12 months) contracts, though I am also open to longer-term arrangements, depending on the specifics of the project.

* **Working Across Time Zones**: I have experience collaborating with colleagues in different time zones (Americas, Europe, and Asia). This is an option, provided the work aligns with asynchronous communication.

* **Languages**: I'm a native Brazilian Portuguese speaker and fluent in both English and German.

* **Company**: I'm registered as a Freelancer (Freiberufler) at the Munich Tax Office (Finanzamt München) in Germany.

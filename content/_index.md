I'm a **Senior Software Engineer** focused on **Backend** and **Cloud** with more than a decade of experience in **building SaaS products, distributed systems, and modern software architectures**.

My work combines **hands-on Software Development** with **Cloud Strategy (AWS), DevOps Practices, and Leadership Experience**. This breadth allows me to bridge architecture, operations, and business requirements into solutions that are effective, scalable, and sustainable.

- I **design architectures** that are flexible, stable in operation, and aligned with business priorities.
- I **connect software engineering, cloud strategy, and product goals** into cohesive systems.
- I **guide teams** so that development work is reliable and effective, and knowledge is shared.
- I **support executives** in making technology decisions that scale sustainably.

## Core Expertise

- **Scalable SaaS Systems** – Secure, Event-Driven, Highly-Available, and Compliance-Ready Architectures
- **Software Architecture & Development** – Elixir, Rust, TypeScript, Node.js, Python; applying DDD and TDD for maintainable, testable systems
- **Cloud & Platform Engineering** – AWS (Serverless, CDK, EKS, ECS, Lambda, DynamoDB), Kubernetes, Terraform, Pulumi, infrastructure modernization
- **Team Enablement** – Mentoring engineers, driving agile practices, and providing Interim Technical Leadership

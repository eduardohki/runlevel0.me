Hey! I'm Eduardo, and I call myself a Software Engineer and AWS specialist.

I started my career in IT Infrastructure when I was 17, and after gaining a lot of experience
in Monitoring, Log Management and then DevOps and Cloud over the years, I finally -- and perhaps
naturally -- found myself on the Software side of things.

I'm always continuously learning, and I find great joy when I'm able to elevate others with my
knowledge and experience, be it by helping teams and businesses with my technical skills or
by simply engaging with the community and paying it forward in the form of free mentoring.

I'm not afraid of working with uncertainty and the unknown -- e.g. to tap into various technology
stacks or problem areas -- and looking back, it was in these situations that I grew the most
professionally. I tend to approach problems holistically and considering not only the technological
aspects but also the human, organizational, and social aspects of every project.

In recent times I found myself in love with the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and
[Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) programming languages, and a taste for the functional programming
paradigm. I also employ [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) extensively in the context of
AWS and Serverless.
